class ChannelTypeFileTransfer(dbus.service.Interface):
    """\
      A channel type for transferring files. The
      transmission of data between contacts is achieved by reading from
      or writing to a socket. The type of the socket (local Unix, IPv4,
      etc.) is decided on when the file transfer is offered or accepted.

      A socket approach is used to make the transfer less dependent on both
      client and connection manager knowing the same protocols. As an example,
      when browsing an SMB share in a file manager, one selects "Send file"
      and chooses a contact. Instead of passing a URL which would then require
      the connection manager to connect to the SMB share itself, the client
      passes a stream from which the connection manager reads, requiring no
      further connection to the share. It also allows connection managers to
      be more restricted in their access to the system, allowing tighter
      security policies with eg SELinux, or more flexible deployments which
      cross user or system boundaries.

      The Telepathy client should connect to the socket or address that
      the connection manager has set up and provided back to the clients
      through the two methods.

      In order to send a file, one should request a FileTransfer
      channel for a contact, including at least the mandatory properties
      (Filename,
      Size and ContentType).
      Then, one should
      call ProvideFile to configure the socket that
      will be used to transfer the file.

      In order to receive an incoming file transfer, one should call
      AcceptFile and then wait until the state
      changes to Open. When the receiver wants to resume a transfer, the Offset
      argument should be should be set to a non-zero value when calling
      AcceptFile.

    Once the offset has been negotiated, the
      InitialOffsetDefined signal
      is emitted and the InitialOffset property
      is defined. The InitialOffsetDefined
      signal is emitted before channel becomes Open.
      The receiver MUST check the value of
      InitialOffset for a difference in offset
      from the requested value in AcceptFile.

      When the state changes to Open, Clients can start the transfer of the
      file using the offset previously announced.
      

      If something goes wrong with the transfer,
      Channel.Close
      should be called on the channel.

      The File channel type may be requested for handles of type
      HANDLE_TYPE_CONTACT. If the channel is requested for any other
      handle type then the behaviour is undefined.

      Connection managers SHOULD NOT advertise support for file transfer to
        other contacts unless it has been indicated by a call to
        UpdateCapabilities.
      
      
        People would send us files, and it would always fail. That would be silly.
