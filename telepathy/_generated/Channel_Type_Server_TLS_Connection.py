      A channel type that carries a TLS certificate between a server
      and a client connecting to it.
      Channels of this kind always have Requested = False,
      TargetHandleType
      = None and TargetHandle
      = 0, and cannot be requested with methods such as CreateChannel.
      Also, they SHOULD be dispatched while the
      Connection
      owning them is in the CONNECTING state.
      In this case, handlers SHOULD accept or reject the certificate, using
      the relevant methods on the provided object, or MAY just Close the channel before doing so, to fall
      back to a non-interactive verification process done inside the CM.
      For example, channels of this kind can pop up while a client is
      connecting to an XMPP server.
