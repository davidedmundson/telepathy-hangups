      An interface for protocols where it might be possible to set the
        user's avatar, and the expected size limits and supported MIME types
        are known before connecting.

      
        If the avatar requirements cannot be discovered while offline,
          it's impossible to avoid setting the Account's Avatar property to an unsupported avatar.
      

      Each property on this interface SHOULD be cached in the
        .manager file, using a key of the same name as the
        property in the [Protocol proto]
        group. All properties are encoded in ASCII decimal in the obvious
        way, except for
        SupportedAvatarMIMETypes which is
        encoded as a sequence of strings each followed by a semicolon
        (as for the "localestrings" type in the Desktop Entry
        Specification).

      For instance, an XMPP connection manager might have this
        .manager file:

[Protocol jabber]
Interfaces=org.freedesktop.Telepathy.Protocol.Interface.Avatars;
param-account=s required
param-password=s required
SupportedAvatarMIMETypes=image/png;image/jpeg;image/gif;
MinimumAvatarHeight=32
RecommendedAvatarHeight=64
MaximumAvatarHeight=96
MinimumAvatarWidth=32
RecommendedAvatarWidth=64
MaximumAvatarWidth=96
MaximumAvatarBytes=8192
