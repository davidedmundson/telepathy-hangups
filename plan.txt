Plan of action:

Structure

setup.py
telepathy-hangups (executable)
TelepathyPython (stripped down version of Tp-python)
TelepathyHangups
.service
.manager

TelepathyHangups

ConnectionManager (created by main app)
Protocol ()
Auth (wraps a TH auth object)
Connection (wraps a TH client object ONCE we've done auth, and ConversationList and UserList)
TextChannel (wraps a TH conversation object)


Plan of attack:
 - keep snippets here

Task 0.1:
(Tp side)
 - create a CM that can be seen in KTp
 - send/receive a hello world
 - show a hardcoded roster

(Hangups side)
 - create a client object, log in,
 - get event for new chat / new message in chat


Milestone 0.2:
 - Using get_auth_stdin + saved cookie file
 - have 1-1 chats working with name in the chat

Milestone 0.3:
 - group chat receive
 - roster, even if using old API as long as it works in KTp

Milestone 0.4:
 - proper auth
 - set_presence

*RELEASE*
